Just some nice things I use in our HomeAssistant setup, happy to share it with you ;-)

# HomeAssistant alert monitoring system

A great sensor alert monitoring system, to warn you if there is something wrong. 

* The original idea was conceived by Chad (ccpk1): https://community.home-assistant.io/t/simple-and-effective-alerting/394027 based on the Home Assistant Alert integration.

I have adjusted some myself (and will expand further) and would like to share it via my GitHub page.

# Howto:
* Just create a new dashboard and use the content of the monitor-dashboard.txt file to fill it for starters
* Copy the content of the packages-folder to your HomeAssistant \\???.???.???.???0\config\packages\ folder
